## PuLID for FLUX
Please check the doc and demo of PuLID-FLUX [here](docs/pulid_for_flux.md).

We will actively update and maintain this repository in the near future, so please stay tuned.

### updates
- [x] Local gradio demo is ready now
- [x] Online HuggingFace demo is ready now [![flux](https://img.shields.io/badge/ü§ó-PuLID_FLUX_demo-orange)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yanze/PuLID-FLUX)
- [x] We have optimized the codes to support consumer-grade GPUS, and now **PuLID-FLUX can run on a 16GB graphic card**. Check the details [here](https://github.com/ToTheBeginning/PuLID/blob/main/docs/pulid_for_flux.md#local-gradio-demo)

## :wrench: Dependencies and Installation
- Python >= 3.9 (Recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
- [PyTorch >= 2.0](https://pytorch.org/) if you don't need flux-dev-fp8, otherwise [PyTorch >= 2.4.1](https://pytorch.org/)
```bash
# clone PuLID repo
git clone https://github.com/ToTheBeginning/PuLID.git
cd PuLID
# create conda env
conda create --name pulid python=3.10
# activate env
conda activate pulid
# Install dependent packages
# 1. if you don't need flux-fp8, e.g., you are using xl or flux-bf16, install the following requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
# 2. if you need flux-fp8 (to put flux on consumer-grade gpu), install the following requirements_fp8.txt
pip install -r requirements_fp8.txt
```
